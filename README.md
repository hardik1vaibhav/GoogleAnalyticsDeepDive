## What is Google Analytics?

Google Analytics is a powerful web analytics service offered by Google. It empowers website owners and marketers to gain valuable insights into their website's performance and user behavior. This includes tracking website traffic, analyzing audience demographics and behavior, monitoring conversions and e-commerce data, and customizing reports. Google Analytics reports can tell you:
-  Where users come from, what pages they visited, and what they do on the site
- Which of your marketing initiatives is most effective
- Accurate website traffic patterns/trends
- Which customer and customer segments are most valuable
- How can the website convert more users into customers
- Which keywords resonate with prospects and lead to conversions
- Which online ad or creative is the most effective
- Where people leave the site
- Which pages retain users the longest
- What search terms do people use to find the site

## Let's understand some Google Analytics Jargon

+ **Acquisition**: How you acquire your website visitors.
+ **Alerts**: Alerts are notifications that you can set up to receive via email or text message when specific events or 
  changes occur in your website's analytics data.
+ **Benchmarking**: This report lets you compare how your website’s metrics perform against other websites of similar size and category. It will give you an idea of how you’re doing in areas such as visits, page views, bounce rates, average time on site, and other metrics, relative to the average business in your category.
+ **Bounce Rate**:  The number of people who visit only one page of your website and then leave (either clicking back to the results page or closing the browser). A high Bounce Rate often indicates that your pages are not relevant to what your visitors are looking for. If you have a high Bounce Rate you may need to develop better-targeted ads, Landing Pages, and perhaps create better content to engage visitors to explore your website.
+ **Branded Traffic**:  This refers to people who come to your website by searching for your brand’s name (or related terms)
+ **Click**: They typically refer to a user interaction with a hyperlink or a button on a website or app. It indicates that a user has actively engaged with a specific element on a page.
+ **Conversion**:  This is what occurs when a goal you have set for a visitor on your website, is completed. Completing a purchase, submitting a contact form, or clicking on a particular ad or page are examples of goals you can measure. Google Analytics allows you to create customized goals so you can measure user actions that are important to your website.
+ **Cookie**:  This refers to a small piece of code that remembers visitors and their preferences when they are on your website
+ **Cost Data**:   information about how much you spend on advertising campaigns or marketing efforts to drive traffic to your website. This data is essential for understanding the return on investment (ROI) and effectiveness of your marketing activities.
+ **Dimensions**:  A Dimension is typically, an attribute of a visitor and their activity on your website. The source that someone came from (referring URL), technical information like browsers or mobile phones, and the activity a person performed such as the landing pages, searches they did on your website, and the products they purchased, are all Dimensions. Dimensions are used to help organize, segment and analyze your website’s data.
+ **Direct Traffic**: Visits to your website where the visitor types your URL (web address) into their browser’s address bar or uses a bookmark to get to your website. Direct traffic tells you what percentage of your visitors know your brand and website URL versus finding your website through a search engine or another website.
